syntax="proto3";

// there are a lot well known type that exist
// reference : https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types

// for example here we use timestamp
// A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or calendar, represented as seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution in UTC Epoch time.
// to use timestamp you should import timestamp
import "timestamp.proto";
// another example can be Duration
// A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution.
import "duration.proto";

message example{
  // then use timestamp type like this :
  google.protobuf.Timestamp ts_field = 1;

  // duration is like timestamp
  google.protobuf.Duration dn_field = 2;
}
