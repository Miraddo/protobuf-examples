// If you want to use your message types with an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system,
// you can define an RPC service interface in a .proto file and
// the protocol buffer compiler will generate service interface code and stubs in your chosen language.
// So, for example, if you want to define an RPC service with a method that takes your SearchRequest and returns a SearchResponse,
// you can define it in your .proto file as follows:


// search request with userid
message SearchRequest{
  int32 user_id = 1;
}

// search response and give the result as userid with username
message SearchResponse{
  int32 user_id = 1;
  string user_name = 2;
}

// create RPC service
service SearchService {
  rpc Search(SearchRequest) returns (SearchResponse);
}
