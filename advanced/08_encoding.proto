// learn how to encoding works in protocol buffer
// https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding

// so let's first learn what is Serialization and Deserialization
// Serialization mean transforming an object into bytes
// Deserialization mean take bytes and get the object

// now look at this code

message Example{
  string name = 1;
}

// with Example message after generate code to golang or any language you want
// we can pass the value of string to the name
// and the output of the Example it will be byte streams
// for more detail you can look at the main.go file
// I used proto.Marshal() and it will return byte streams


// So to return byte streams to main data we can use proto.Unmarshal()
// it take bytes and set it to our struct of Example or whatever that we had

// key it in your mind then go to read the reference it explain everything in details :)
