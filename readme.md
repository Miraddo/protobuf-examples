# Protocol Buffers Examples with Go
In this repo, you can find some essential parts of the code that wrote with proto3.

I tried to explain each not part as simply as I could as a comment inside the files.

## Installation Protoc
`Protoc` is the tool that let us compile the `.proto` files to the main code that we want to use

It's so easy to install `protoc` in MacOS/Linux, but for windows it might be a little hard
so here I encourage you to install `choco` as the package manager for windows choco is short of [chocolaty package manager](https://chocolatey.org/)

after installing `choco`, just run your Terminal/PowerShell/CMD then run `choco install protoc` it will be installed automatically
